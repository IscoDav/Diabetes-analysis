    "# Diabetes Classification \n",
    "This project and its Classification Model aims to identify whether patients have <b>DIABETES</b> or not by analyzing results of their other medical analyses and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Diabetes \n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot use the sugars and starches (carbohydrates) it takes in as food to make energy. The body either makes no insulin or too little insulin or cannot use the insulin it makes to change those sugars and starches into energy. As a result, extra sugar builds up in the blood.(2020, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services)\n",
    "\n",
    "The three most common types of diabetes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Type 1 :</b> In type 1 diabetes, your immune system mistakenly treats the beta cells in your pancreas that make insulin as foreign invaders and destroys them. This can happen over a few weeks, months, or years.(2022, American Diabetes Association)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Type 2 :</b> In type 2 diabetes, your body does not use insulin properly. This is called insulin resistance. At first, the beta cells make extra insulin to make up for it. But, over time your pancreas can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but can appear in young people.(2022, American Diabetes Association)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Gestational :</b> Gestational diabetes is diabetes that develops during pregnancy. For most women, blood sugar levels will return to normal after giving birth. (2022, American Diabetes Association)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pregnancies \n",
    "Normally, various hormones work to keep your blood sugar levels in check. But during pregnancy, hormone levels change, making it harder for your body to process blood sugar efficiently. This makes your blood sugar rise.(2022, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glucose  \n",
    "Diabetes is a problem with your body that causes blood sugar (also called blood glucose) levels to rise higher than normal. This is also called hyperglycemia.(2022, American Diabetes Association)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you eat, your body breaks food down into sugar and sends it into the blood. Insulin then helps move the sugar from the blood into your cells. When sugar enters your cells, it is either used as fuel for energy right away or stored for later use. In a person with diabetes, there is a problem with insulin.(2022, American Diabetes Association)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Fasting Blood Sugar Test</b>\n",
    "This measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.(2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blood Pressure\n",
    "Blood pressure is the pressure your heart uses to push blood through your blood vessels and around your body. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two numbers used to describe blood pressure and it’s measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). It’s written like this: 130/80mmHg. And you’ll hear your doctor say '130 over 80'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first number is the systolic pressure. This is the most amount of pressure your heart uses when beating to push the blood around your body. \n",
    "The second number is the diastolic pressure. This is the least amount of pressure your heart uses when it is relaxed between beats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blood pressure should be below 140/80mmHg for people with diabetes or below 130/80mmHg if you have kidney or eye disease or any condition that affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain** (2022, The British Diabetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skin Thickness\n",
    "**In fact, skin problems are sometimes the first sign that a person has diabetes.**\n",
    "The average Skin Thicknes for patience who has diabetes is 29.15 +-\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insulin\n",
    "Insulin helps control blood glucose levels by signaling the liver and muscle and fat cells to take in glucose from the blood. Insulin therefore helps cells to take in glucose to be used for energy.(2022, The British Diabetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### BMI\n",
    "\n",
    "BMI (Body Mass Index) is a number calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by his or her height in meters squared. BMI is a useful tool used in determining the degree of an individual's excess weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being overweight **(BMI of 25-29.9)**, or affected by obesity **(BMI of 30-39.9)** or morbid obesity **(BMI of 40 or greater)**, greatly increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The more excess weight you have, the more resistant your muscle and tissue cells become to your own insulin hormone. More than 90 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or affected by a degree of obesity. (2011, Obesity Action Coalition (OAC))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diabetes Pedugree Function\n",
    "Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "Age is a big risk factor for type 2. The older you are, the more likely you are to have it. That also holds true for preteens and teenagers, whose diabetes rates have climbed sharply in recent years.(2020, WebMD, LLC)"
